Verglas, the Northern Irish EdTech start-up founded by a group of 17–18-year-olds, has announced the launch of IglooCode 2024 in partnership with Liberty IT and Kainos.

IglooCode is a capture-the-flag style programming and cryptography competition for Year 8 to 10 pupils from Northern Ireland, aimed at those looking to study IT, Digital Technology, or another similar subject at GCSE. This unique competition was run for the first time in 2023, welcoming over 100 pupils from 16 schools and receiving much positive feedback from local teachers.

Students are split into teams of four and log in to the online IglooCode platform. They are presented with a list of 500+ programming tasks to complete across categories such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C#, Scratch, and BBC Micro:bit. Over a period of two hours, students race to complete as many tasks as they can from the category of their choice, battling against other schools for the top prize of an Arduino Starter Kit each.

Teachers of KS3 ICT across Northern Ireland can now submit their application to take part in the competition on the IglooCode website. Applications are open until 24th November.

Verglas are also offering volunteering positions to sixth-form students who may be interested in helping out at the event, which will be held in early-to-late March 2024 at Queen's University Belfast. Applications for these positions are also open now, until 21st December.

Samuel Bhuiyan, past volunteer, said, "IglooCode was a fantastic learning experience for me that allowed me to develop my programming, social, and networking skills all in one. Despite volunteering more than half a year ago, some of the people I worked with there I'm still working with today as a degree apprentice at Kainos."

"If it weren't for that initial experience at IglooCode, I'm not sure I would have had the confidence to make it this far, so I am eternally grateful for it. From talking to the kids both during the event and after it, I can tell it was a great learning opportunity for everyone involved."

Schools across Northern Ireland are invited to apply as soon as possible to be in for the chance to show off their programming skills and become the Royal Belfast Academical Institution's successors to win IglooCode 2024.

Hi! My name is Dan. I'm 17 and I go to Slemish College in Ballymena, where I'm studying AS Software Systems Development, Business and Geography.

Ever since I was a kid, I've been really interested in computers, whether it be playing around with random Northwind Access databases or trying to access the hidden system files in Windows XP. As long as I can remember I've always been keen to know more, so whenever my mum told me that websites were made from "code" on the way home from school one day in P2, I couldn't resist trying it out. In the years since, my skills have developed tremendously – from making simple POS apps in C# to fully fledged software packages using a multitude of frameworks, just like the one I developed for IglooCode.

Coding has always been a hobby of mine that I aspire to turn into a career. Projects like IglooCode have proven that I love developing in a team; messing around with pull requests and code reviews has been so fun – a highlight of the competition planning. There are so many different fields that I've had the opportunity to explore within computing, some even drawing in my other hobbies and interests. I've been able to play around with AI and ML in natural-language processing to further develop my love for linguistics, and I've also spent countless hours researching another great interest of neuroprosthetics and brain-computer interfaces (think, Sword Art Online).

It was always our goal to make IglooCode a worthwhile and important event for everyone who took part. IT and software is one of the fastest growing industries in Northern Ireland, so we made a huge effort to get the younger generation involved, and give them the chance to discover something they love, and to take advantage of the many opportunities out there.

IglooCode started as a day out to meet our friend Emma's Code Club at Strathearn School in Belfast, but later developed into the county-wide event that took place in March. Emma, Aideen and I met during the 2022 CyberFirst Advanced course in Queen's University, where we made loads of new friends who we're still very close with today – most of the IglooCode staff team this year were also on the course.

Working alongside my friend Jake to put together the capture-the-flag software was one of the first times I have ever collaborated with someone else on a development project. I had the challenge of figuring out how Git pull requests and code reviews worked, not to mention the couple hundred times we had to fix merge conflicts.

Overall, the feedback we received for the event was overwhelmingly positive. The vast majority of schools who attended have said that IglooCode was an outstanding event which was very well organized, and have encouraged us to host the event again next year.

We are all very keen to host IglooCode again next year, hopefully again with the support of Liberty IT, Kainos and Queen's University, who we couldn't have done it without this year thanks to their generosity and time they invested into getting us off the ground.

My name is Aideen McHugh. I'm 18 and attend Slemish College in Ballymena. I study Maths, Physics and Software Systems Development at A-Level.

I have been passionate about technology since I was a child. I loved playing on my Nintendo DS and I dreamed of someday being able to make games just as well as some of my favourites. Over the years, my focus has shifted towards software development, which I intend to pursue a career in, however I still have a passion for making short games as well as a hobby. I primarily use C#, however I have used Python and Javascript as well.

I got involved in IglooCode when my friend Daniel suggested the idea to me at our code club one day. We run an after-school club for Year 8 and 9 students at our school, which I started last year, and I thought it would be a really great idea. Initially, we planned to bring together our code club with the one at Strathearn, ran by our friend Emma who we met at CyberFirst over the summer, however we widened our horizons which resulted in 16 different schools coming together. 

One of my main intentions with IglooCode was making sure it was cross-community, as someone who has been in integrated education since P3, I understand the importance of bringing kids from different backgrounds together. This is why we invited so many schools and didn't limit it to certain backgrounds, beliefs, or where they were academically selective – even though the competition was the main event, the students would still have an opportunity to make friends they would never have met otherwise.

One of my main takeaways from running IglooCode was how much thought and planning goes into events like it. When I have attended competitions in the past, I hadn't realised how much effort went into every single choice made. It really made me appreciate the dedication that people who plan and organise competitions have, especially throughout the long process of developing the idea into what it becomes. 

The impact that we made on the students by arranging the competition isn't one that can be measured in a traditional sense, but from their constant excited buzz throughout the day, it was clear that they had a great time. This has made us eager to run IglooCode in the future.
